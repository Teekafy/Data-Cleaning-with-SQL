# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL
______________________________
Data is an essential component of any organization, and its accuracy and completeness are critical to making informed decisions. However, data is rarely perfect, and it is common to find errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. These data quality issues can have a significant impact on the results of data analysis, and it is essential to address them through a data cleaning process.

In this project, we will focus on data cleaning using SQL. SQL is a powerful language for managing and querying data, and it offers a range of tools for data cleaning. We will use SQL queries to identify data quality issues, apply transformations to clean the data, and validate the results.

Our goal is to produce a clean and reliable dataset that can be used for analysis and decision-making.

Side note: There were two or three columns in this dataset that weren't cleaned.

Reason: The values were incorrectly typed in and they can't be manipulated, if I was cleaning this for an organization, I would have rectified them. Besides, they may not necessarily be used for analysis.

I imported the data from a worksheet and exported back to a workshet after I was done cleaning.
